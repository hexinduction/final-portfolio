By buying delicious, ready-to-eat dinners made from whole foods that work for most dietary frameworks, meals are donated to hungry people in the user's community.

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p class="blurb top-blurb">Create an app for a product which combines meal delivery and charitable giving. Users need to: <br><br>Review dinner menu.<br><br>Schedule meals in advance or order as needed.<br><br>Choose a charitable organization to distribute donated meals.<br><br>Feed hungry people in the user’s community.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="right problem">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p class="blurb">Haricot allows users to donate meals to hungry people in their communities, while having nutritious, seasonal dinners conveniently delivered to their doorsteps. The idea is simple: <br><br>View and select meals from the dinner menu for the nights you need dinner, or select the current dinner for immediate delivery.<br><br>Modify meals to fit your unique dietary needs. You can choose from a dietary framework, and/ or modify meal ingredients as needed.<br><br>Choose a charitable organization to distribute meals donated from your orders.<br><br>Give the same meal you are eating to a hungry person in your community. For each meal purchased, the same meal goes to an underfed person. In this way, users break bread with those they seek to help, even if not together, physically.</p>

              <p class="blurb">Many services exist to get meals to users’ doorsteps. A variety of companies specialize in prepared meals with focus on convenience and/or nutrition. I conducted a competitive analysis for each of the following meal delivery services: Freshly, Blue Apron, and Hello Fresh. <br><br>Blue Apron and Hello Fresh each offer meal kits which contain all the ingredients for, and instructions to cook, a particular meal. Freshly offers frozen prepared meals which require reheating in the oven. Blue Apron and Hello Fresh each cater to those who desire to learn to cook well, while desiring guidance, and providing a grocery-store free experience. Freshly, on the other hand, seems to cater to those who are looking for convenient, nearly ready-to-eat meals, and may have dietary restrictions. Hello Fresh and Blue Apron convey a sense of the experience of cooking. Freshly conveys a sense of removing the hassle of shopping and cooking from eating.<p>

Referring back to these stories was essential for avoiding scope creep.<br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="blurb">I wanted the name of the service to reflect central philosophies of interdependency and growth. The name should call to what the service does while declaring “We’re all in this together!” I explored a lot of motifs and ideas, but ultimately loved the ring of using the name of a vegetable. Many names were entertained, but “haricot”  conveyed everything the company represents. Haricot is the common name for pole beans. It rolls off the tongue while referring to the proverbial “peas in a pod,” in this case, all those in a community together. <br><br><br><br></p>

                <h3>Logo</h3>
                <p>The logo is a natural extension of the name. A lyrical script text recalls the curling vines on which haricots grow. Below the name are three “seeds” or beans. The final of the three splits open to signify new life and growth.</p>

                <p class="blurb">Tackling problems as big as hunger can seem daunting. Haricot wishes to convey a sense of encouragement. The color palette, like the logo, is uplifting, fun, and active. A complimentary logo color scheme juxtaposes the deep purple which rounds out the main palette.<br><br><br><br>Ultra is, as it’s name suggests,  big and superlative with lots of juxtaposition. It has a stark contrast of weight, with thick strokes and thin terminals. It’s surprising, fun, and hard to miss. It’s weight gives it a feeling of security and steadfastness. <br><br>Heebo is a great support. It’s legible and clean. The variety of weights and styles are more than ample. Heebo is used mostly for body text. Use regular weight for this. H3s and occassionally H2s will be set in Heebo, using bold. </p>

Still, there is much to be done with the app. So far there is a prototype for an app using Google Material guidelines. The next steps for the app are:<br><br>Design an iOS-compliant app.<br><br>Design the desktop app.<br><br> Add a statistics page (for fun animated visuals of how much you donated).</p>

                <h3>Meta-Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="blurb">This project was a special challenge. First, it was very rewarding to work on a product which involved my passion in community action. My experience with volunteer work, food service, and food production informed my design process. It was my first experience designing a product where the service wasn’t software. Logistics had to be discovered and considered very early on. This is where user stories informed actions far beyond the app. An operations team would be an ideal addition to the planning stages of such a product.</p>
